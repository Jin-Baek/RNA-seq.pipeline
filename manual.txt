RNA-seq pipeline Manual

[Setting R files download directory]

All folders are created at the location of the main.R file.
All R files must be located on the same path.
Trimming, alignment, quantification processes are perform based on samples which located in /samples path & All samples should be same end mode

[Required option]

-df		Download URL about reference genome file(fa.gz or fasta.gz) / gtf file(gtf.gz) 
		The order and number of input URL doesn't matter. 
		If you already download, locate each file in each path. Then this process will be passed. 
		- reference genome: /reference
		- gtf: /annotation
		
-Ptrim		Put trimmomatic-v.jar file's path 

-Padapt		Put adapters/TruSeq-endMode.fa file's path

-em 		Put end mode (SE: single end, PE: pair end)

-ref		Put reference genome(fastq.gz) which located in /reference path  

-i 		Put index file name which located in /index (Ex. *_IndexFile)

-an 		Put annotation file(gtf.gz) which located in /annotation path 

-sm		Put sample txt file which contains sample SRA id 

-dump		Put dump file which automatically download samples 

-species		Put species name (Ex. Gallus_gallus, Mus_musculus) which you use on reference genome and annotation gtf file

[Option]

-tp1		Put trimmomatic parameter LEADING
		The default values is 3 

-tp2		Put trimmomatic parameter TRAILING
		The default values is 3 

-tp3		Put trimmomatic parameter MINLEN 
		The default values is 36
